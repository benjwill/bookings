        <p>Pastries A Go Go won out as the name of the new bakery opened in 1995, by Executive Pastry Chef Bob Light and his wife Lek. It seems growing up in the “go-go” era supported this more interesting name than runner’s up; “Flour Sack” and “Rolling Pin.” Based on Bob’s expertise in baking, there was no plan initially to make the new establishment any more than a bakery café, serving mainly baked items and coffee.</p>
        <p>Before long, bakery customers began to request more traditional breakfast and lunch meals. The menu was expanded to include items like bacon, eggs and biscuits and soup and sandwiches. We still have no plans to ever be open for dinner – but have been serving a full breakfast, lunch and brunch menu to complement our bakery for many years now.    </p>
        <p>We make our own pork and turkey sausages. Our famous Cat-head Biscuits have been written up in several local newspapers. It is our bakery items that still often take center stage. Our chocolate chip cookies were written up in Atlanta magazine (December 2001) as one of the best in town. We also specialize in American and European style cakes.    </p>
        <p>Pastries A Go Go moved to a new location (right across the street) in Commerce Square in 2005. We have a greatly improved space, with lots of easy parking and wonderful outdoor patio seating. We were able to completely design the space down to the custom color of the walls – “pillowcase green.” We might even share the color mix if you ask “sweetly.”</p>
        <p>We offer special occasion cakes and pastries for weddings, anniversaries and birthdays – for any size event. We have our famous Mini-Cakes (2-person cakes) every day, but please check for the flavors of the day (every cake is not available every day). The Mini-Cakes can also be special ordered as full size cakes. And don’t forget to try one of our Mice. No, not the furry kind. Chef Bob created the Mouse, a delicious Buttercream cookie, with almond filling, dipped in chocolate with almond accents, in 1996; his answer to the Olympic Izzy, and still a big favorite today. We will entertain your special request too – so please talk to Chef Bob.</p>
        <p>All of our food is prepared using only fresh and seasonal ingredients, as Lek goes to the market every day. Our goal is to pamper and nurture your taste buds in a mouth-watering yet healthy way. You must experience our service and food to understand it. Please come and visit with us soon.</p>
